It redirects me to something but triggers an error!
Redirecting to a new update means there's a new version available, if it opens your browser let it download the file and that's the new
version!
If you however get an error at the tool instead here are the other download sources:
- Premium bot at Discord, do the command !!download
- Web Dashboard, access it from my Discord
